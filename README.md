Our working definition of language encompasses five structural components: phonol
ogy, semantics, syntax, morphology, and pragmatics.

Phonology refers to the sounds and the intonation patterns that are associated with spoken
language.
Semantics encompasses the words of a language and the meanings associated with those words.
Syntax describes the grammatical rules of a language—how words combine into phrases and sentences.
Morphology refers to the rules that govern the use of morphemes. Morphemes are the smallest units of meaning in a language, including the prefixes and suffixes that mark syntactic and semantic information, such as number (i.e., plurals), gender, and tense (i.e., past, present, or future). Finally, pragmatics is how we adjust our speech to our audience and use language toward the goal of communication

To better address typical and atypical language development as well as strategies of prevention and intervention, the five structural components of language may be simplified into three essential aspects of communication:
content, form, and use (Bloom & Lahey, 1978).

Content refers to the semantics of language—the concepts and ideas that are encoded in words.
Form is the way in which meaning is represented, including speech, sign language, and writing. In the context of spoken language, form encompasses phonology, morphology, and syntax.
Finally,
use refers to the function of language in context.

Although each of these aspects of language can be identified separately, they are inherently interconnected elements in communication (Bloom & Lahey). Language problems may arise when there is a disruption within any one component of the model or in their integration. The following sections consider the typical development of each of these aspects of language.

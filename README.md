<p>Our working definition of language encompasses five structural components: phonology, semantics, syntax, morphology, and pragmatics.</p>
<ul>
<li>-Phonology refers to the sounds and the intonation patterns that are associated with spoken language.</li>
<li>-Semantics encompasses the words of a language and the meanings associated with those words.</li>
<li>-Syntax describes the grammatical rules of a language—how words combine into phrases and sentences.</li>
<li>-Morphology refers to the rules that govern the use of morphemes. Morphemes are the smallest units of meaning in a language, including the prefixes and suffixes that mark syntactic and semantic information, such as number (i.e., plurals), gender, and tense (i.e., past, present, or future). </li>
<li>-Finally, pragmatics is how we adjust our speech to our audience and use language toward the goal of communication</li></ul>

To better address typical and atypical language development as well as strategies of prevention and intervention, the five structural components of language may be simplified into three essential aspects of communication:
content, form, and use (Bloom & Lahey, 1978).


<ul><li>-Form is the way in which meaning is represented, including speech, sign language, and writing. In the context of spoken language, form encompasses phonology, morphology, and syntax. Finally,</li>

<li>-use refers to the function of language in context.</li>
<li>-Content refers to the semantics of language—the concepts and ideas that are encoded in words.</li></ul>

Although each of these aspects of language can be identified separately, they are inherently interconnected elements in communication (Bloom & Lahey). Language problems may arise when there is a disruption within any one component of the model or in their integration. The following sections consider the typical development of each of these aspects of language.

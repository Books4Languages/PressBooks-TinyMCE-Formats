<p>Our working definition of language encompasses five structural components: phonology, semantics, syntax, morphology, and pragmatics.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phonology</strong> refers to the sounds and the intonation patterns that are associated with spoken language.</li>
<li><strong>Semantics</strong> encompasses the words of a language and the meanings associated with those words.</li>
<li><strong>Syntax</strong> describes the grammatical rules of a language—how words combine into phrases and sentences.</li>
<li><strong>Morphology</strong> refers to the rules that govern the use of morphemes. Morphemes are the smallest units of meaning in a language, including the prefixes and suffixes that mark syntactic and semantic information, such as number (i.e., plurals), gender, and tense (i.e., past, present, or future). </li>
<li>Finally, <strong>pragmatics</strong> is how we adjust our speech to our audience and use language toward the goal of communication</li></ul>

To better address typical and atypical language development as well as strategies of prevention and intervention, the five structural components of language may be simplified into three essential aspects of communication:
content, form, and use (Bloom & Lahey, 1978).


<ul><li><strong>Form</strong> is the way in which meaning is represented, including speech, sign language, and writing. In the context of spoken language, form encompasses phonology, morphology, and syntax. Finally,</li>
<li><strong>Use</strong> refers to the function of language in context.</li>
<li><strong>Content</strong> refers to the semantics of language—the concepts and ideas that are encoded in words.</li></ul>

Although each of these aspects of language can be identified separately, they are inherently interconnected elements in communication (Bloom & Lahey). Language problems may arise when there is a disruption within any one component of the model or in their integration.

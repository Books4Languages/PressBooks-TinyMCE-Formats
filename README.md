# PressBooks-TinyMCE Formats

## Description

### About

With PressBooks-TinyMCE-Formats for Wordpress you can split the information of one page in the 3
formats of language: form, use and content.
(Future development news formats for well structured page)

We want to make the language courses more user-friendly. This is the first step.

**Because the first step for teaching is organizing the ideas.**
